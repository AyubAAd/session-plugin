# Document Session Context

Documentation work. Need project knowledge to write accurate docs.

## Load Immediately

Nothing. Documentation is driven by what's being documented.

## Provide as Paths

- `.project/overview.md` - project description
- `.project/constitution.md` - principles, constraints
- `.project/stack.md` - technologies used

## Determine Scope

Ask:
```
What documentation needs work?
- Project files (.project/)?
- README?
- Code docs?
- API docs?
```

## Based on Response

Read the specific files being documented or referenced.

For code documentation, also read the source files being documented.

## Ask

```
What are we documenting?
```
